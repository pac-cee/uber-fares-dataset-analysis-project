TABLEAU PUBLIC DASHBOARD CREATION GUIDE
======================================

1. DATA CONNECTION:
   • Open Tableau Public
   • Connect to Text file: uber_tableau_ready.csv
   • Also connect to the aggregated files for summary views

2. RECOMMENDED DASHBOARD STRUCTURE:

   A. OVERVIEW PAGE:
      • KPI Cards: Total Rides, Revenue, Avg Fare, Avg Distance
      • Fare Distribution Histogram
      • Rides by Hour Line Chart
      • Geographic Map with Pickup Locations

   B. TEMPORAL ANALYSIS PAGE:
      • Hourly Pattern Line Chart
      • Daily Pattern Bar Chart
      • Monthly Trends (if multiple months)
      • Peak vs Off-Peak Comparison

   C. GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS PAGE:
      • NYC Map with Pickup/Dropoff Density
      • Borough Comparison Charts
      • Inter-Borough vs Intra-Borough Analysis
      • Distance from Center Analysis

   D. BUSINESS INSIGHTS PAGE:
      • Fare Prediction Factors
      • Revenue Optimization Opportunities
      • Passenger Behavior Analysis
      • Seasonal Patterns

3. KEY VISUALIZATIONS TO CREATE:

   • Map: Use pickup_lat_rounded, pickup_lon_rounded for performance
   • Time Series: Use pickup_datetime for temporal analysis
   • Heatmap: Hour vs Day of Week for fare patterns
   • Scatter Plot: Distance vs Fare relationship
   • Bar Charts: Borough, Time Period, Passenger Category comparisons

4. FILTERS TO ADD:
   • Date Range Filter
   • Borough Filter
   • Time Period Filter
   • Distance Category Filter
   • Passenger Count Filter

5. CALCULATED FIELDS TO CREATE:
   • Revenue per Hour = SUM([fare_amount]) / COUNT([pickup_hour])
   • Efficiency Ratio = [trip_distance_km] / [fare_amount]
   • Peak Hour Indicator = IF [pickup_hour] >= 7 AND [pickup_hour] <= 9 
                          OR [pickup_hour] >= 17 AND [pickup_hour] <= 19 
                          THEN "Peak" ELSE "Off-Peak" END

6. DASHBOARD DESIGN TIPS:
   • Use consistent color scheme
   • Add interactive filters
   • Include tooltips with relevant information
   • Create drill-down capabilities
   • Add trend lines where appropriate
   • Use dashboard actions for interactivity

7. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   • Use data extracts instead of live connections
   • Limit map visualizations to reasonable sample sizes
   • Use aggregated data for summary views
   • Consider using context filters for large datasets
