## 4. Advanced Statistical Analysis

### 4.1 Correlation Analysis
**Strongest Correlations with Fare Amount:**
1. Trip distance (r=0.799) - Primary fare determinant
2. Manhattan distance (r=0.784) - Alternative distance measure
3. Fare per passenger (r=0.742) - Derived metric
4. Inter-borough indicator (r=0.309) - Location premium
